## üöÄ **Product Vision**

*"Create the first skill-based endless match-3 game that eliminates player frustration through directional control while maintaining the accessibility and satisfaction of traditional matching games."*

### **Core Innovation: Swipe-Directional Flow System**
- Player swipes control where new blocks spawn from
- Eliminates "no moves available" scenarios
- Creates strategic depth through spatial planning
- Maintains simple, accessible core gameplay

### **Revolutionary Mechanics:**
1. **Directional Block Flow** - New blocks come from edge opposite to swipe direction
2. **Center-Flow Pressure** - Objects naturally migrate toward high-value center zones  
3. **Next-Block Influence** - Player actions affect future tile placement patterns
4. **Endless Survival** - No artificial level gates or energy systems
