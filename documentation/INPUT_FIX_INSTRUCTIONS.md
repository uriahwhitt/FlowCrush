# ðŸ”§ Input System Fix Instructions

## **Issue**: Input System Compatibility

Your Unity project is using the **new Input System package**, but the TouchInputManager was trying to use the **old Input system**, causing continuous errors.

## **âœ… Solution Applied**

I've created a **SimpleInputManager** that works with both input systems and updated all references.

## **Quick Fix Steps**

### **Option 1: Replace TouchInputManager (Recommended)**

1. **Stop the scene** if it's playing
2. **Find the TouchInputManager GameObject** in the Hierarchy
3. **Delete it** (it's causing the errors)
4. **Add SimpleInputManager** to the SceneInitializer GameObject
5. **Play the scene** - it will create the new input manager automatically

### **Option 2: Manual Setup**

1. **Create a new GameObject** called "SimpleInputManager"
2. **Add the SimpleInputManager component** to it
3. **Delete the old TouchInputManager** GameObject
4. **Play the scene**

## **What Changed**

- âœ… **Created SimpleInputManager** - Compatible with both input systems
- âœ… **Updated SceneInitializer** - Now creates SimpleInputManager
- âœ… **Updated GameManager** - Now references SimpleInputManager
- âœ… **Removed problematic TouchInputManager** - No more input errors

## **Expected Result**

After the fix, you should see:
- âœ… **No more input errors** in the Console
- âœ… **Working mouse input** in the editor (click and drag)
- âœ… **Swipe detection** working properly
- âœ… **Console logs** showing swipe directions when you swipe

## **Testing the Input**

1. **Click and drag** in the Game window
2. **Watch the Console** for swipe detection messages
3. **Try different directions** (up, down, left, right)
4. **Check that tiles respond** to swipes (in future development)

## **Success Indicators**

âœ… **No input errors** in Console
âœ… **Swipe detection working** (try clicking and dragging)
âœ… **Game grid still visible** and functional
âœ… **All systems operational**

The SimpleInputManager is designed to work regardless of Unity's input system settings, so you shouldn't see any more input-related errors!
