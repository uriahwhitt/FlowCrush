# Input System Compilation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SimpleInputManager.cs - Namespace Conflicts
**Problem**: The `Input` class methods were being interpreted as being in the `FlowCrush.Input` namespace instead of `UnityEngine.Input`.

**Fixed References**:
- `Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)` → `UnityEngine.Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)`
- `Input.mousePosition` → `UnityEngine.Input.mousePosition`
- `Input.GetMouseButton(0)` → `UnityEngine.Input.GetMouseButton(0)`
- `Input.GetMouseButtonUp(0)` → `UnityEngine.Input.GetMouseButtonUp(0)`
- `Input.touchCount` → `UnityEngine.Input.touchCount`
- `Input.GetTouch(0)` → `UnityEngine.Input.GetTouch(0)`

### 2. TouchInputManager.cs - Ambiguous TouchPhase References
**Problem**: `TouchPhase` was ambiguous between `UnityEngine.InputSystem.TouchPhase` and `UnityEngine.TouchPhase`.

**Fixed References**:
- `TouchPhase.Began` → `UnityEngine.TouchPhase.Began`
- `TouchPhase.Moved` → `UnityEngine.TouchPhase.Moved`
- `TouchPhase.Ended` → `UnityEngine.TouchPhase.Ended`
- `TouchPhase.Canceled` → `UnityEngine.TouchPhase.Canceled`

### 3. SimpleInputManager.cs - TouchPhase References
**Fixed References**:
- `TouchPhase.Began` → `UnityEngine.TouchPhase.Began`
- `TouchPhase.Moved` → `UnityEngine.TouchPhase.Moved`
- `TouchPhase.Ended` → `UnityEngine.TouchPhase.Ended`
- `TouchPhase.Canceled` → `UnityEngine.TouchPhase.Canceled`

## Root Cause
The issues were caused by:
1. **Namespace Conflict**: The project has a `FlowCrush.Input` namespace, which conflicted with `UnityEngine.Input`
2. **Input System Package**: Unity's new Input System package introduces `UnityEngine.InputSystem.TouchPhase`, creating ambiguity with the legacy `UnityEngine.TouchPhase`

## Solution
- Explicitly qualified all `Input` class references with `UnityEngine.Input`
- Explicitly qualified all `TouchPhase` enum references with `UnityEngine.TouchPhase`
- This ensures compatibility with both the old and new Unity input systems

## Verification
- Created `CompilationTest.cs` to verify all input-related types are accessible
- All compilation errors should now be resolved
- The project should compile cleanly and be ready for play mode

## Next Steps
1. Test the Sprint1Test scene to ensure input is working correctly
2. Verify that both mouse (editor) and touch (mobile) input work as expected
3. Test swipe detection functionality
4. Remove the `CompilationTest.cs` script once testing is complete
